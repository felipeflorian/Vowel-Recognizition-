# Vowel-Recognizition

Project for vowel recognizition in *spanish*. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, where was used a database for training the model, and another to test the model. I was done a preprocessing of the data and determine some restrictions to process the data. The model is a neural netork with more than 90% of accuracy. Moreove, we can conclude afer the tests that the model was more than 60% effective at classifying vowels.
