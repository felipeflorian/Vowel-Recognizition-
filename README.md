# Vowel-Recognizition

Vowel recognition project in *Spanish*. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (*spanish*) in which a database was used to train the model and another to test it. It was done a data preprocessing and determined some constraints to process the data. The model is a neural network with greater than 90% accuracy. Following the tests, we can conclude that the model was more than 60% effective at classifying vowels.
